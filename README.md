CallosalData
============

The human corpus callosum has more fibers, and is more important, than previously suggested.

Here, we've written scripts for processing downloaded figures and recording published data from a number of publications detailing anatomical data of the corpus callosum.

#### Use-cases

1. Use the data directly from the `data` directory.  Documentation on what is stored can be found in the corresponding `code` files.
2. Re-collect the data by running `collect_all` from the `code` directory.  This would require you to drop all images into the root `img` directory, and you'll need to contact me to get them.
